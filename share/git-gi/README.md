## About

[gitignore.io](http://gitignore.io/)  is designed create useful .gitignore files for your project.

A gitignore file specifies intentionally un-tracked files that git should ignore.  When creating git repositories many project folders get filled with files that are not necessarily related to the source code.  These files come from places such as the Operating System (OS), Programming Languages, and Integrated Development Environments (IDE).

## Build

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:joeblau/gitignore.io.git
$ cd gitignore
$ npm install -d
$ node app.js
```
